## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

Our goal for this application was to make a user experience that allowed them to navigate the rawg.io API in a manner that is suited for an easy and intuitive layout in order to provide the information on the video games they wish to gain more knowledge upon. We learned how to work together as a group to achieve a MVP within a weeks worth of work. Specific skills acquired include the ability to fully implement a chart.js graph with API data inserted in the graph, also picking up lots of knowledge on fetching API's and creating dynamic elements to the website, other abilities obtained: Bulma, FontAwesome, googleFonts. these different frameworks, libraries and resources allowed us to accomplish our goal of having a minimum viable product.

## Features

- We used chart.js hover abilities on the charts in order to get specific data that they relay. 
- We have a save option for specific games the user might wanna view in the future.
- The user may also encounter modals that prevent them from going further on their search if the specified game is not typed in correctly.
